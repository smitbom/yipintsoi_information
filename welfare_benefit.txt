####History and Origins of Yip In Soi Company

Yip In Soi is a company with a long history. The company's name comes from its founder, Mr. Yip In Soi, a Chinese immigrant to Thailand. Initially, the company was involved in mining operations, but later expanded into various sectors. Currently, its main businesses are in three areas: agriculture-fertilizers, Sissons branded household paints, and IT solution businesses.

Yip In Soi has been in the IT business for 30-40 years. It now calls itself a total solution provider, offering comprehensive IT services ranging from consultation, system development, to IT outsourcing from clients. Additionally, Yip In Soi has IT businesses through subsidiaries such as TCCL and Tangerine.

Yip In Soi, the young man who is dedicated and enthusiastic, interned in the banking sector in Hong Kong for two years after graduating from a leading university in China. He returned to assist his father's trading business. His father's involvement provided him with the opportunity to travel to view trading operations in southern Thailand. At that time, mineral trading and mining were promising businesses, especially with the emergence of the Pak Tung sub-mining business. The trading opportunity at the Pangnga smelter led Yip In Soi to see the opportunity to become a buyer of minerals for sale to the smelter. The business improved gradually. From an office on 2nd floor, 2 Koala Road, Hat Yai, it then established "Yip In Soi & Company Limited" in 2473 BE with a registered capital of 150,000 baht and 7 shareholders, including Mr. Yip In Soi, Mr. Yap Long, Mr. Leck Nam Kim, Mrs. Lem Siam, Mr. Goxun, Mr. Goxunlin, and Mrs. Hor Yai.

The first board of directors of the company consisted of Mr. Yip In Soi, Mr. Yap Long, and Mrs. Lem Siam. The company's main office was located in Amphoe Banthawai, Phra Nakhon Province.

In the southern region and some provinces in the northeastern region of Thailand, "YIT Investment & Securities Ltd. (YISCO)" and "Yipintsoi Finance Limited.

Later renamed to "Ekathongkajit Capital Company Limited," Yip In Soi began venturing into the technology business in the Buddhist calendar year 2497 by becoming a distributor of the "Burroughs Adding Machine," a state-of-the-art office equipment at the time. Additionally, the "Division B" (short for "Burroughs") was established in 2501 to focus exclusively on the sales of these products. In 2506, Thawatchai Yip In Soi, who held a master's degree in business administration from Cornell University, USA, joined the technology business. Starting with research and development to make Burroughs computers capable of printing Thai language, a challenging task at that time. In 2516, the business expanded into the distribution and installation of mainframe computers, with Theanchai Lailert playing a significant role.
